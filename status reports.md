We ordered an Echo and an Echo Dot from Amazon this week. They will arrive next week and we will work on creating a small sample app to get started with. We a preliminary user test, where we took turns being Alexa, and wrote down what user interactions came up.

The Echo arrived this week and we began developing the Alexa skill. We have hooked up our skill to DynamoDB to persist user data. The basic functionality for a fridge list works now, for example:

Alexa, I bought a banana.
Alexa, I also got a grapefruit.
Alexa, I ate the banana.
Alexa, what's in the fridge?
> There is a grapefruit in the fridge.

We're still looking for a sponsor for the project. We have a few meetings lined up next week with professors to see if they're interested. We talked to Soha as a potential sponsor and she gave us a lot of feedback on the project design, as well as possible extensions or roadblocks along the way. She's not the official sponsor but we took her feedback and wrote an updated proposal using it.
