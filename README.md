Food and Nutrition Management Using Alexa
Team Purple Mountain Majesty: Ivan Chen, Justin Jo, Thomas Rind
Sponsor: Norman Ramsey

Our mission is to create a food management application that tracks the food in the fridge and, through Alexa,  makes suggestions on what to eat and buy based on the foodâ€™s expiration date and nutrition.  Our ultimate goal is to  save families money and improve their eating habits.
